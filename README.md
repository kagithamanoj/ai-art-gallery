## Quick Start

### 1. The Prompt Formula
Effective prompt engineering follows a specific structural hierarchy:
`[Subject] + [Style] + [Medium] + [Lighting] + [Composition] + [Quality Modifiers]`

See `prompts/prompt-engineering-guide.md` for the full breakdown.

### 2. Ready-to-Use Prompts
The library contains over 2,000 prompts across 12+ categories, including image generation, chatbot personas, and industry-specific workflows.

### 3. Style References
A dedicated guide for choosing art styles, technical camera settings, and color palettes can be found in `styles/style-reference.md`.

## Usage

Standard categories are available in the `prompts/` directory. For example, to generate a high-end cinematic city scape, refer to the `image-generation` category.
